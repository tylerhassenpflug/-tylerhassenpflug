A business strategy consultant helps business owners or organizational leaders with decision making in regards to their business strategy. They understand and can lead you through the processes that will help you determine who you are, where you want to go, how you will get there, and how you will measure success.

In 2017, I started a business strategy consulting company with a classmate from Tufts. For the first year he took this on as a full time job in order to help grow the client base and take on projects.  In 2018 we both decided to work on these projects part time on top of our full time jobs. Since starting the company, I have worked full time as a Project Manager for an international biotechnology company.

Since starting the company we have taken on over a dozen emerging and established life science and technology companies to provide:

► Development and implementation of business strategy;
► Product, brand, and team development;
► Financial, asset, market, and risk research and analysis;
► M&A, Due diligence, Fundraising, & Technical sales.  

Several of our projects have been with the same technology company where we have advised a pivot from diagnostics to predictive analytics and data product for food safety and compliance industry. We have also, executed market research, competitive intelligence strategy and business development in target markets.

The business strategy consulting we have done for this company helped them reach over $1 milllion in series A funding.
