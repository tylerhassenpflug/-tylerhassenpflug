As a Project Manager in the tech industry we trained according to the PMBOK model. PMBOK stands for Project Management Body of Knowledge.  In this model,  we trained how to to specifically scope, schedule budget and breakdown projects into parts.  This approach helps to better organize and communicate project deliverables.  

In the tech industry, Projects Managers are trained to use a very different approach for managing projects.  Recently, while working for a large biotechnology company, was assigned to cross train on leading not only process engineering and business strategy projects but to also be the site lead on managing IT and software projects.  On this project, I led site wide software platform digital upgrade project utilizing PMBOK, scrum and lean methodologies.  This project required me to manage teams across sites in the US, Denmark and India.  The project included both technical and line of business upgrades for digital platform as well as SOPs, policy and procedure updates.

Scrum and lean methodologies are specifically used to manage projects in the software industry.  In the scrum methodology, the project is broken down into chunks of deliverables and referred to as waterfall.  Although there is some overlap between PMBOK and SCRUM, the general approach is very different.
