			    My personal interests include:
        </p>
			<ul>
			  <li>
				 <b>Data Analytics</b>. For the first time ever data is emerging as a valuable resource on par with oil and gas. I am interested in how
         to leverage data in a responsible and ethical way to solve problems.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				  <b>Travel</b>. I've been an enthusiastic traveler since I was a teenager - but only as an adult am I able to afford to travel outside
          new england. In the past three (3) years I have hiked the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu in Peru, sailed the coast of Croatia and most
          recently drove across northern Thailand on motor-bikes. The last one may or may not have resulted with a trip to the ER in rural
          Thailand but that's a story for another time.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				  <b>Mountaineering, Rock Climbing and Ice Climbing</b>. I live in the Pacific Northwest, home of some of the greatest mountains and trails in the country. I enjoy spending weekends
          on scrambles and getting lost in the woods.

          OpenGidget is an open-source fork of Raspbian Linux that makes it easier to auto-provision a headless Raspberry PI,
          get it onto your WiFi network, and deploy simple Python and Ruby scripts that run at startup - all without needing to plug in a keyboard/monitor.
