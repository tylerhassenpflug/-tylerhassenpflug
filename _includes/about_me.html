            I have over 9 years of experience in the biotech and info tech industry, and have worked
            at both small startups and large organizations. Throughout my career, I have held postions in
            process engineering, project managment, software engineering and bussiness strategy consulting.
            While I'm a proficient software development and process engineer, my expertise is in managing
            cross functional teams.

           I love building things.
           While hard engineering problems are often intrinsically fun to tackle,
           I'm most attracted to solving real customer and client problems with a business justification.
           I'm looking for a product management or senior individual contributor role where I can take on
           on collaborative team leadership responsibilites, and gain more experience with
           full stack engineering and project management.
