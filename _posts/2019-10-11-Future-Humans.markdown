The concept of exoskeletons is both fascinating and terrifying.  Exoskeletons are
being developed to solve a wide range of problems from worker fatigue in manufacturing,
helping rehabilitate people who have been injured and even creating better soldiers
on the battle field. These exoskeletons come in a wide array of shapes, sizes, weights
and functionalities.  As with most technologies, the are pro's and con's to the
development and use of exoskeletons. Two risks that concern me the most are the
use of exoskeletons by military or terrorist groups and if there are long term health
effects from using exoskeletons such as muscular or bone atrophy.

Toyota has developed an exoskeleton to help prevent shoulder injuries in workers
that do lots of repetitive overhead work. Once the workers raise their arms above a
certain point, the exoskeleton kicks in and does all of the work.  I'm very curious
to find out if there are any muscle issues from long term use. If these workers
aren't relying on their muscles to raise their arms overhead and building muscle
while they perform these tasks, will this lead to muscle atrophy? I guess only
time will tell. Could this also happen for people using exoskeletons to help
them perform other tasks? How long until we end up looking like the humans from
Wall-E?

Russia is currently developing a human exoskeletons to be used by soldiers on
the battlefield.  These suits look like something out of the movie Iron Man.
Versions of their soldier exoskeletons are already being tested and they are
aiming to have a completed version for use by 2025.  I think its fairly safe to
assume that at some point, weapons of war eventually end up in the wrong hands
or they used misused for power.  Whether is by the military of certain countries
or terrorist organizations, human exoskeletons could prove to be one of the deadliest
weapons created in recent history.
