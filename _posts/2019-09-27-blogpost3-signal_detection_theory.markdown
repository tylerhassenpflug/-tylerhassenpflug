Recently in my Human Machine System Design course, we were learning about
signal detection theory.  In class we ran experiments with 60 short samples to
gauge how good we were at detecting motion in a specific direction.  Each clip
was only shown for a second or less.  Needless to say I was not very efficient
at detecting the direction correctly.  

After class, I began to think about how and it ways could signal detection
theory be used in daily life. Once I got home, I did what most people do when
they have a question about something, I Googled it.

One way in which this can be used is in a police line-up or trying to identify
a criminal from a survelance video.

By using signal detection theory along with machine learning, authorities can
more accurately determine the guilty perpetrator in a crime.  In recent studies,
it was determined that eye-witnesses choosing criminals out of a line-up was
only accurate 1/6 or approximately 17% of the time.
