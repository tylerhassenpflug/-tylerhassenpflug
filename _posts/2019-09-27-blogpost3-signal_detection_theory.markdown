Recently in my Human Machine System Design course, we were learning about
signal detection theory.  In class we ran experiments with 60 short samples to
gauge how good we were at detecting motion in a specific direction.  Each clip
was only shown for a second or less.  Needless to say I was not very efficient
at detecting the direction correctly.  

After class, I began to think about how and it ways could signal detection
theory be used in daily life. Once I got home, I did what most people do when
they have a question about something, I Googled it.

One way in which this can be used is in a police line-up or trying to identify
a criminal from a survelance video.

By using signal detection theory along with machine learning, authorities can
more accurately determine the guilty perpetrator in a crime.  In recent studies,
it was determined that eye-witnesses choosing criminals out of a line-up was
only accurate 1/6 or approximately 17 percent of the time. These numbers are terrifying.
It really makes you think about how many issues there are with the criminal justice
system and how many "innocent" people have been convicted of crimes they didn't commit.
By using Signal Detection Theory and machine learning, one study showed that
the accuracy of correctly identifying criminals increased to nearly 80 percent. While
80 percent still not perfect, its a lot better than 17 percent.

The term Signal Detection Theory is slightly misleading.  It shouldn't be thought
of as a theory that can be proven or disproven, but more so of a way to think
about data.  However, because they're are using four (4) different variables,
it becomes difficult to visually represent the data collected. The four (4)
different variables include: hits, misses, correct rejections and false alarms.  
One data visualization method is performed by using a Receiving Operator
Characteristics Curve or ROC. What the ROC does is graph the probability of a hits
vs the probability of a false alarm.

Using Signal Detection Theory allows us to get a better look at the data for real
life issues like correctly identifying criminals.
