This. class. kicks. @ss!

I've been fascinated by new and innovative technologies for as long as I can
remember.  Having decided to make career change from the biotech industry
into the tech industry as a product manager, this course exceeded all
expectations in helping to broaden my knowledge of current and future technologies.
Best all, through this course I was able to meet and work with other students and
professionals that share my passion for technology.

As I wrap up my semester in a class titled Human Machine Systems Design, I
thought it might be nice to highlight some key takeaways. This class emphasized
the importance of human centered design across several fields of technology.
We studied and discussed the design challenges associated with designing complex
systems at the intersection of humans and machines. We covered topics of systems
automation, signal detection theory, internet of things, future humans, chatbots
and social robotics to name a few.  We dove into deep discussion and group
projects to investigate humans and machines working together and which tasks
might be best delegated to people vs. machines, and problem of how to instill
user trust. Each topic explored was additionally framed in the context of
designing for not just the user defined in the “now”, but also for the potential
user of the future both near and far.

The Internet of things (IOT) has grown significantly in the past few years. IOT has
expanded into nearly every industry from health and fitness to automobiles and
smart homes.  Smart homes now can aid in nearly every aspect of our with devices
such as smart bulbs, thermostats, security cameras, baby monitors, smart tv's and
refrigerators. Smart home devices can be very beneficial by helping us to better
control our heating or assisted living for the elderly. However, IoT is not safe
and our data is not safe until it is secure.

An understanding of signal detection and information theory is crucial when
determining how humans should interact with machines. Signal detection theory is
a great framework to utilize when considering the impact of a “hit” “miss” “false
A machine system can be altered to adjust the sensitivity to each of the above
detection conditions, thereby making some more likely and others less likely.
Adjusting these can be extremely important in cases where a false alarm or miss
has grave consequences.

The concept of future humans and exactly how robots will be able to help daily
human activities is not as far in the future as many may think. The concept of
exoskeletons is both fascinating and terrifying.  Exoskeletons are
being developed to solve a wide range of problems from worker fatigue in manufacturing,
helping rehabilitate people who have been injured and even creating better soldiers
on the battle field. These exoskeletons come in a wide array of shapes, sizes, weights
and functionalities.  As with most technologies, the are pro's and con's to the
development and use of exoskeletons. Two risks that concern me the most are the
use of exoskeletons by military or terrorist groups and if there are long term health
effects from using exoskeletons such as muscular or bone atrophy.

Big data ties into so much of our lives on a daily basis.  A majority of companies,
especially tech companies, are collecting large amounts of data on its users.  
For example, every morning when I get in my car, google maps and Waze tell me
exactly how long it will take to get from my current location to the parking
garage at Tufts in Medford or my apple watch will send me a message around 4 pm
telling me I'm usually further along with my exercise for the day on days I skip
the gym.  These companies track our movements every minute of the day.  They know
where we are, what we are doing, how much we are moving and if we are asleep or
awake.  This amount of data collection is terrifying, especially if this
information is being misused.

A social robot is defined as "an autonomous robot that interacts and communicates
with humans or other autonomous physical agents by following social behaviors and
rules attached to its role. Like other robots, a social robot is physically embodied."

Social robots provide an exciting and somewhat terrifying glimpse into the future.  
These robots will be able to assist around the home with every day chores or help
in industries such as aerospace and medicine.  Social robots will be able to serve
across several functions both in personal life and industry. The future of social
robots is envisioned as a robots using artificial intelligence to interact with
humans.Social robotics have exciting potential for implementation in various settings as
they are able to autonomously interact and communicate with humans. This impressive
capacity is enabled by a few things. Most broadly, social robots are automated
machines. Automation simply means the machine is able to complete its set of tasks
with minimal human assistance. There are different levels of automation, and
subsequently different levels of human assistance necessary. Some of the
technologies that help human machine systems become more autonomous include the
use of Big Data, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. Each of these
topics is further discussed in other blogs of mine so I won’t go too much in depth
here. My key takeaways here however, are that these tools are extremely powerful.
This power is both exciting when considering the potential doors it opens for new
applications of human machine systems, but should be considered as being equally
terrifying, as a failure to consider the ethical and societal implications of
said implementation could result in grave consequences.

I am excited to see how each of the topics studied in this class will grow and
change over time.  I can only hope to be part of the innovation shaping the way
for future technologies.
