This. class. kicks. @ss!

I've been fascinated by new and innovative technologies for as long as I can
remember.  Having recently decided to make career change after spending nine years
serving in both technical and management level roles the biotech industry, into the
tech industry as a product manager, this course exceeded all expectations in helping
to broaden my knowledge of current and future technologies.  Best all, through this
course I was able to meet and work with other students and professionals that share
my passion for technology.  Overall, this course was the perfect level of exposure
to several topics. There were a couple topics I wish we had spent a bit less time
on and couple that I wish we had dove a bit deeper into. I will discuss each of
these throughout this blog post.

This class emphasized the importance of human centered design across several fields
of technology. We studied and discussed the design challenges associated with
designing complex systems at the intersection of humans and machines. We covered
topics of systems automation, signal detection theory, internet of things, future
humans, chatbots and social robotics to name a few.  We dove into deep discussion
and group projects to investigate humans and machines working together and which tasks
might be best delegated to people vs. machines, and the problem of how to instill
user trust. Each topic explored was additionally framed in the context of
designing for not just the user defined in the “now”, but also for the potential
user of the future both near and far.

One topic I find particularly fascinating and aim to pursue a career in is the
Internet of things (IOT), more specifically wearable devices.  IOT has grown
significantly in the past few years. IOT has expanded into nearly every industry
from health and fitness to automobiles and smart homes.  Smart homes now can aid
in nearly every aspect of our with devices such as smart bulbs, thermostats,
security cameras, baby monitors, smart tv's and refrigerators. Smart home devices
can be very beneficial by helping us to better control our heating or assisted
living for the elderly. However, IoT is not safe and our data is not safe until
it is secure.  There are several amazing products in this industry with lots of
room for growth on improvements and development of new products.

Another topic I really enjoyed learning about was signal detection theory. An
understanding of signal detection and information theory is crucial when
determining how humans should interact with machines. Signal detection theory is
a great framework to utilize when considering the impact of a “hit” “miss” “false
A machine system can be altered to adjust the sensitivity to each of the above
detection conditions, thereby making some more likely and others less likely.
Adjusting these can be extremely important in cases where a false alarm or miss
has grave consequences.

The concept of future humans and exactly how robots will be able to help daily
human activities is not as far in the future as many may think. The concept of
exoskeletons is both fascinating and terrifying.  Exoskeletons are
being developed to solve a wide range of problems from worker fatigue in manufacturing,
helping rehabilitate people who have been injured and even creating better soldiers
on the battle field. These exoskeletons come in a wide array of shapes, sizes, weights
and functionalities.  As with most technologies, the are pro's and con's to the
development and use of exoskeletons. Two risks that concern me the most are the
use of exoskeletons by military or terrorist groups and if there are long term health
effects from using exoskeletons such as muscular or bone atrophy.

Big data ties into so much of our lives on a daily basis and plays a part in
several of the other topics discussed in this course.  A majority of companies,
especially tech companies, are collecting large amounts of data on its users.  
For example, every morning when I get in my car, google maps and Waze tell me
exactly how long it will take to get from my current location to the parking
garage at Tufts in Medford or my apple watch will send me a message around 4 pm
telling me I'm usually further along with my exercise for the day on days I skip
the gym.  These companies track our movements every minute of the day.  They know
where we are, what we are doing, how much we are moving and if we are asleep or
awake.  This amount of data collection is terrifying, especially if this
information is being misused.

Social robots provide an exciting and somewhat terrifying glimpse into the future.  
A social robot is defined as "an autonomous robot that interacts and communicates
with humans or other autonomous physical agents by following social behaviors and
rules attached to its role. Like other robots, a social robot is physically embodied."
These robots will be able to assist around the home with every day chores or help
in industries such as aerospace and medicine.  Across the industries studied in this
course, several social robots are already being developed to help in certain industries.
For example, robotic flight attendants and robotic bar tenders are already becoming
tested by companies for use.  These robots will be able to serve both in personal
every day life and within industry functions. The future of social robots is
envisioned as a robots using machine learning artificial intelligence to interact with
humans.  Social robotics have exciting potential for implementation in various settings as
they are able to learn from each interaction as well as autonomously interact and
communicate with humans. This impressive capacity is enabled by a few things.
Most broadly, social robots are automated machines.

Automation simply means the machine is able to complete its set of tasks
with minimal human assistance. The level of automation required for AI robotics can
vary wildly depending on what functionality or interaction is required. Some of the
technologies that help human machine systems become more autonomous include the
use of Big Data, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. One topic that applies
to each of this is cyber security.  As technologies advance, so do the skills of
hackers.  It seems that nearly on a weekly basis there is some story on the news 
about a companies data being hacked to expose the information of thousands, if not
millions of people.  What happens if one these hackers decides to hack into an
autonomous vehicle while someone is driving down the road or hack into a robotic
flight attendant in the middle of a flight? These new technologies are equal parts
exciting and terrifying.  In the words of Uncle Ben from Spiderman "with great power
comes great responsibility!"

I am excited to see how each of the topics studied in this class will grow and
change over time.  I can only hope to be part of the innovation shaping the way
for future technologies.
