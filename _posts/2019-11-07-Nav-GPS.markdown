GPS technologies are helping innovate and change many things for the better. Apps
such as Waze, Google Maps, Trip Advisor and Yelp are helping people save time and
discover new things every day.  Sadly and also terrifying, GPS technologies are also
being used detrimental ways.  Iâ€™d like to draw your attention to a much less
glamorous side of GPS: location tracking. Location tracking is being used by the
government, private corporations and hackers to track our locations and in some cases
aiming to steal our identities or rob our homes.

Does it surprise you that this is happening? More and more we are hearing stories
about how peoples phones and locations are being hacked to see where they are
and what they're doing at all times. Hackers are using this method to see when we
are away from our homes or to hack into our devices.  Governments and companies
are using this to invade our privacies "for our own protection."
